# Travelling Salesman

This is a rewrite in rust of the work done by the students:

- [Raul F. Mansur](https://github.com/raul4247),
- [Matheus L. O. Spindula](https://github.com/Matheussop),
- [Luiz J. V. Santos](https://github.com/SeraphyBR)

in the discipline of "Projeto e An√°lise de Algoritmos", 5th period of Computer Science at PUC MG.

You can find the original work in c++ [here](https://github.com/raul4247/travelling-salesman)

## Objective:

The objective of the work is the study and the implementation of algorithms to solve
the Traveling Salesman Problem using the following paradigms:

-   Brute force
-   Branch and bound
-   Dynamic programming
-   Genetic algorithm
